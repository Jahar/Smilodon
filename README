Smilodon is a viewer for Virtual Worlds such as Second Life*.  Smilodon is based upon the Ascent codebase, adding in features such as Lance Corrimal's Sailor's Minimap and updating it to support Display Names and other newly added features.

I use the screenname Jahar Aabye in Second Life*, and I script weapons on that platform for Black Operations Combat Outfitters, aka BlackOps.

As far as I know, the Ascent codebase v1.4.3.0 on which this project is based contained no malicious code, and I have added no malicious code to it.

Smilodon is, at best, an amateur production.  I have very little coding experience, I am not a professional programmer, and I am definitely out of my league.  Anyone using this software does so at their own risk.  

I cannot be held responsible if this program crashes your computer, crashes your car, deletes your files, or worse, deletes your porn.  This software may also be changed, revised, or made obsolete by acts of Linden Lab, acts of G_d, acts of Lindens in GodMode, acts of Congress, acts of Sexual Congress, or One Act Plays.

*Second Life is a trademark of Linden Lab.  The Smilodon viewer has not yet been approved by Linden Lab as a Third Party Viewer, but I believe that it is fully compliant with Linden Lab's Third Party Viewer Policy (TPVP) to the best of my ability.
